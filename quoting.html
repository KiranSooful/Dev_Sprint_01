                <h2>7. Quoting, paraphrasing and summarising</h2>
                <p>
                  Any writing you do at university will require reference to recognised
                  experts or authorities in that particular subject area (discipline),
                  to give the thoughts, ideas and information in your assignment
                  credibility. There are three ways of including the ideas of an expert
                  in your text: quoting, paraphrasing, summarising. No matter what you choose to
                  do, you must acknowledge the source of these ideas.
                </p>
                <h3>7.1 Quoting</h3>
                <p>
                    Short quotes, quotes of less than three lines, should be written into
                    the paragraph and shown by quotation marks: “ .............”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Long quotes, quotes of more than three lines or 40 words, should be
                  indented and separated from the paragraph. No quotation marks are needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  [ ] Square brackets in a quote show that the writer has added words to
                  the original quote. This may be necessary to clarify what is being said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An ellipsis … mark shows that part of the quote has been omitted. This
                  is useful if you don't want to include all of a statement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  if the quote you are copying comes from a source other than the author of
                  the book you are reading, you should cite the original source then the
                  author you are reading.
                </p>

                <h3>7.2 Paraphrasing</h3>
                <p>
                  Paraphrasing means using your own words to report someone else's material or
                  ideas. You will need to paraphrase when you want to change the style or the
                  language used in the original either to make it easier to understand or to make
                  it fit better into your own piece of writing. Unlike a summary, a paraphrase
                  is usually about the same length as the original, but both the words and the
                  sentence structure must be changed in a paraphrase. An idea that has been
                  paraphrased must also acknowledge the source of that idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most effective way to paraphrase is to use the following method:
                </p>
                <p>
                  1. Read the sentence or sentences several times carefully to make
                  sure you understand the meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. Highlight the key words and phrases.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. Cover up the original and try writing down the substance of the
                  sentence/s from memory in your own words.
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. Now check the original. Make sure you did not leave out anything
                  important or added something that isn't there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  5. Check your wording. Make sure you have not used the same words as the
                  original. If you have, change them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  6. If the original contains a phrase that you find particularly striking and
                  you do not want to change this expression, put quotation marks around it
                  and only paraphrase the rest. Do not overuse quotes though as you will lose
                  the flow of your writing.
                </p>
