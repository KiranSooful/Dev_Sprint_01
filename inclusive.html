                <p>
                    Charles Darwin University (CDU) is an education provider as
                    well as an employer. As a public institution, CDU is legally
                    obliged to ensure that all staff and students can work in an
                    environment that is free from harassment and discrimination.
                    It is important for all members of the university community
                    to recognise and value cultural diversity and understand the
                    importance of using inclusive language as a way of creating
                    an harmonious environment.
                </p>
                <h3>2.1 What is inclusive language?</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                    Inclusive language is language that does not belittle,
                    exclude, stereotype or trivialise people on the basis of
                    their race, gender or disability.
                    </strong>
                    At university there are a number of people from different
                    cultural and linguistic backgrounds as well as people with
                    disabilities, different sexual preferences and holding
                    varied religious or spiritual belief systems. We all have a
                    responsibility to respect these differences and ensure that
                    our speech and language is appropriate and
                    non-discriminatory. This means avoiding terms which are
                    offensive or using language that portrays certain people in
                    negative ways.
                </p>
                <h3>2.2 Language and culture</h3>
                <p>
                    An Indigenous Australian is someone of Aboriginal or Torres
                    Strait Islander descent, identifies as an Aboriginal or
                    Torres Strait Islander and is accepted as an Aboriginal or
                    Torres Strait Islander in the community in which he/she
                    lives or has lived.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The term aboriginal, written with a small ‘a’ is used to
                    describe indigenous people around the world and fails to
                    recognise the uniqueness of Indigenous Australians.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The term Aboriginal, with a capital ‘A’, on the other hand
                    denotes Indigenous Australians and is therefore a more
                    appropriate word to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Indigenous Australians are not, however, a homogeneous group
                    and prefer to be called by the language or cultural groups
                    to which they belong. For example, in the Northern Territory
                    there are many different groups such as the Larrakia
                    (Darwin), Tiwi people who live on Bathurst and Melville
                    Islands, the Yolngu from Arnhem Land and the Warlpiri from
                    areas north and west of Alice Springs.
