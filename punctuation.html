                <h2>6. Punctuation</h2>
                <p>
                    Punctuation marks help you to organise your words into
                    clauses and sentences, and hence into identifiable units of
                    meaning. They are the signs that alert readers to the
                    appropriate pauses in your text. These pauses signal where
                    you intend the emphasis and intonation to be placed, and
                    thus how you want the text to be read. Punctuation marks
                    help you tell the reader how to find the meaning from your
                    organisation of the words. Thus, punctuation is more than
                    just an incidental aspect of writing. It is an essential
                    skill that helps you to express yourself clearly, directly
                    and effectively.

                <h3>6.1 End marks</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                      End marks are used to end a sentence. They enable you to
                      tell your reader where one thought ends and another
                      begins. Thus, end marks help you keep your ideas distinct
                      so that your reader can understand what you have written.

                      There are three ways in which a sentence can be ended:
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Full stop
                    This sentence finishes with a full stop.
                    This sentence does not!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Exclamation mark. An exclamation mark should be used when you intend the
                    sentence to be either a strong command or an emphatic
                    declaration. For example: Do as you are told!
                    [strong command] Idiot! [emphatic declaration].
                    Question mark. This is used to indicate a direct question.
                    For example:What did you mean by that outrageous claim?
                </p>
                <h3>6.2 Commas</h3>
                <p>
                  Being able to identify independent and dependent clauses will
                  help you to decide where to put commas (or other punctuation)
                  in your writing. An independent clause contains a subject and
                  a verb. For example: The tree was losing its leaves. So it is
                  a complete sentence in itself. However, a dependent clause
                  cannot stand on its own. If it is written alone, it doesn't
                  make sense. It is an incomplete sentence. This is because it
                  is usually missing a subject, or a verb or both. For example:
                  Because of the drought.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We join dependent and independent clauses together to ensure:
                  The meaning is clear: The tree was losing its leaves because
                  of the drought. The sentence is complete: Because of the
                  drought, the tree was losing its leaves. Commas are needed to
                  clarify meaning when dependent and independent clauses are
                  added to each other to form complex sentences. The general
                  rules with commas in complex sentences are: If the dependent
                  clause comes after the independent clause (highlighted), no
                  comma is necessary. Village councils play the main role in
                  resolving disputes and meting out justice. If the dependent
                  clause is before the independent clause, you need a comma.
                  Outside of the major cities, village councils play the main
                  role in resolving disputes and meting out justice. If the
                  dependent clause is in the middle of an independent clause or
                  in the middle of two independent clauses, you need a comma
                  each side of it. The whole parliament, aside from the President,
                  agreed with the proposed legislation. Zahraâ€™s family, who had
                  lived in a small village all their lives, suddenly decided to
                  move to the city. Tehran, with a population of more than twenty
                  million, is a busy, chaotic city.
