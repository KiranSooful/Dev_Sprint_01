                <h2>3. Common problems in language construction</h2>
                <p>
                    In this section, common problems relating to language
                    construction have been identified so that students can
                    become aware of these and avoid them in their writing.
                </p>
                <h3>3.1 Sentence Structure</h3>
                <p>
                    Sentences can be short and concise, or longer and more
                    complex. However, it is important to vary the length of your
                    sentences so that your writing doesn't sound too abrupt
                    (with the overuse of short sentences), or too densely packed
                    with ideas (with the overuse of long sentences).
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the most common problems in writing is students
                    writing sentence fragments rather than complete sentences.
