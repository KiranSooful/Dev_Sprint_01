                    In this section, we take you through some of the ways in which
                    you can write using an academic style which is appropriate and
                    grammatically correct. We provide you with information on what
                    to expect and how to go about achieving a satisfactory academic
                    style, including the use of inclusive language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you come from a background where English is not your first
                    language, it will be helpful to you to look at the section on
                    common problems in language construction. If you feel your style
                    is too informal or colloquial, read the section on making your
                    language sound formal and what to avoid. There is also a useful
                    guide to using punctuation and for including the ideas from
                    research literature in your writing.

                    language usage as well as developing your skills to edit and
                    proofread your assignments.
